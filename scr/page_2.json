Each one of those represent a row.Is this normal? I checked getStaticProps and it is only triggered once (as I expected) but I checked the logs of the server and I can see every single one of those requests Is executing a query to the database.Why is this happening?

That is merely an example of how the implementation might go about implementing a particular container.And no, the internals of the standard library are not available for \"customization\". At least, not as defined by the standard. Different implementations could have #defines or something to allow you to pick some specifics, but those would be defined by particular implementations.Broadly speaking, if you need to control specific details of a particular container, beyond what the standard library allows, you implement it yourself.",
        "This diagram is for illustration purposes, only. It is meant to explain the underlying fundamental concepts of a linked list.None of the containers in the C++ library expose these kind of internal details. They expose only the documented methods, as explained in your C++ textbook and the C++ standard. std::list for example (which is a doubly-linked list), exposes begin() and end(), that return the beginning and the ending iterator; and several other methods that provide access to the contents of the list. None of these kind of internal pointers get exposed.The extent of \"customization\" is defined by the container itself, namely by the template parameters. The first template parameter to std::list defines what's in the linked list. That's your customization: it customized what's in the linked list, an ordinary int or a complicated class. Other parameters to other templates specify additional level of customizations. Various parameters to std::map, for example, specify the map's key and value, and a comparison operator that sets the order of the iteration of the map's key. That's quite a bit of customization, there."

Function b() uses c() and c() uses d(). Now function d() also produces some results and in function a() I need to have a list of these results.The above solution collects these results by passing a variable list d_results from one function to the other, to which d() is adding data and that is read by a(). This is very inconvenient, because functions b() and c() don't even know what d_results is about! They're just blindly passing a variable.Can this be solved more elegantly? In a way that b() and c() don't have to care about d_results?Global variables are not OK, because this is part of a http request handler and I need the data to be 'local' to a request.I know that in XSLT (quite a different type of language, but hey...) there's a concept of 'tunneling' parameters through a chain of templates, but this is not known in Python, I suppose?Or is this just a sign that my code isn't structured properly?In case you're curious, the d() function stores some data on the GAE datastore and the d_results are Futures for these operations, for which I want to collect the results in function a(). It's not necessarily a()'s business, but for performance reasons the operations must be done async in d() and so I need some place to handle the Futures, which has to be a(), because that's where the iteration is taking place."

        "I am writing a python script to create a schedule so that we can run some jobs using the schedule object we create. The schedule object has Class variable called schedule, which is list, which contains the allowed schedule for the jobs to run. The parameters for the schedule object is shown below. I need to create a datetime.time object to which I will pass the starttime parameter, example (19,00,00) so that the schedule starts at 19:00:00 and based on the time_increment, the next schedule in the list will be (19,30,00) and so on until the endtime has reached. (example (00,00,00) , once the schedule object has been created, we will link the job with schedule using some method (yet to be created).My big problem is that I am not able to add the time object. i.e. I created datetime.time object called mystarttime. Then add 30 mins via timedelta and it fails with error below. I don't want to create a datetime.date object as this is time object is not specific to particular date or day. Hence not sure what I am missing and what I need to modify in my code    mystarttime = datetime.time(19,00,00)    time_to_change = dt.timedelta(minutes=30)    new_mytime = mytime + time_to_changeError:My time is 19:00:00Traceback (most recent call last):File \"/Users/suresh/tmp/python-test/test1.py\", line 28, in main()File \"/Users/suresh/tmp/python-test/test1.py\", line 23, in mainnew_mytime = mytime + time_to_changeTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'datetime.time' and 'datetime.timedelta'My Class definition:class Schedule:    schedule = []    def __init__(self, starttime, endtime, time_increment):        self.starttime = starttime        self.endtime = endtime        self.time_increment = time_incrementAlready specified in the details section."

        "I'm trying to make an <a> tag element animates in an underline on hover, similar to the first example on this page. Asking this almost feels stupid since the tutorial is RIGHT THERE, but something I'm doing isn't working and I'm not sure why.Here's what I've got in my CSS#about-text-box a {    text-decoration: none;    font-size: 17pt;    font-family: 'Silkscreen', cursive;    color: #ECE0E7;    text-align: center;    width: 95%;    text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #101400;    transition: 0.5s;}#about-text-box a:hover::after, #about-text-box a:focus::after {    opacity: 1;    transform: translate3d(0, 0.2em, 0);}#about-text-box a::after {    position: absolute;    bottom: 0;    left: 0;    width: 100%;    height: 0.1em;    background-color: inherit;    opacity: 0;    transition: opacity 300ms, transform 300ms;;}",
        "A few missing properties I noticed:content: '' on a::after is missing. For a pseudo-element, the content property can be empty \"\", but must be specified.position: relative need to be on a because pseudo-element a::after is using position: relative.a::after is using background-color: inherit but does not seems to have any value that can be inherited. I gave it a value hotpink for now, but this can be customized to any color.I added cursor: pointer on a so it is more matching your desired result.Hope this will help!Example: (see live demo with button below)#about-text-box {  display: flex;}#about-text-box a {  display: block;  position: relative;  padding: 0.2em 0;  cursor: pointer;  text-decoration: none;  font-size: 17pt;  font-family: \"Silkscreen\", cursive;  color: #ece0e7;  text-align: center;  text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #101400;  transition: 0.5s;}#about-text-box a:hover::after,#about-text-box a:focus::after {  opacity: 1;  transform: translate3d(0, 0.2em, 0);}#about-text-box a::after {  content: \"\";  position: absolute;  bottom: 0;  left: 0;  width: 100%;  height: 0.1em;  background-color: hotpink;  opacity: 0;  transition: opacity 300ms, transform 300ms;}<div id=\"about-text-box\">  <a>Link link link</a></div>"

For instance, it doesn't work with ls which is an alias of ls --color=auto on Ubuntu by default.So, must I create a function to do that ?It could first do the check with command -v and if it doesn't work use a regex to find where the alias is linked to and try again with the regex result.But I would be surprised if it was the right solution tho... Actually, it would be strange if there was no program on Linux to check if a program does exist or doesn't, right ?EDIT :by \"doesn't work\" I mean :$ if [ -x \"$(command -v python)\" ]; then echo \"python exists\"; fipython existsbut if I type :$ if [ -x \"$(command -v ls)\" ]; then echo \"ls exists\"; fi   nothing is printed hereI would like the condition to detect that the program exists all the same."

    "contenus": [
        "I have a textarea id=\"task\", which has a word counter id=\"count\" connected. The counter is set to count spaces between words, so a word is only accounted for if one puts a space after it. However, if for whatever reason one finds themself in a frenzy of hitting the spacebar, each and every space is then counted as a word which thwarts the final count. Below is the code for you to see for yourselves.What I am asking is as follows:1) Is there a way to count only one space after each word and ignore multiple spaces?2) Can I prevent multiple spaces in the textarea?Since I am suspecting that the solution dwells within the realm of javascript, I kindly ask for your help as I am still a noob. I will be grateful for any suggestions, be it 1) or 2). HTML:    <div class=\"options\">    Task:                <textarea type=\"text\" rows=\"10\" cols=\"97\" name=\"task\" id=\"task\" onkeypress=\"onTestChange01();\"    autocorrect=\"off\" spellcheck=\"false\"></textarea>               <p>Word count: <textarea cols=\"10\" name=\"count\" id=\"count\" readonly>0</textarea></p>    </div>JAVASCRIPT:    // WORD COUNTER FUNCTION    var count = document.getElementById('count');    var input = document.getElementById('task');    input.addEventListener('keyup', function(e){    wordCounter(e.target.value);    });    function wordCounter(text) {    var text = input.value;    var wordCount = 0;    for (var i = 0; i <= text.length; i++) {      if (text.charAt(i) == ' ') {        wordCount++;      }          }    count.innerText = wordCount;    }I tried fiddling with the JS function and its values. Also, I found a function to change multiple spaces to one space, which did not work as expected and it disrupted the original function and the counting.Finally, I tried preventing 'space' altogether in the textarea properties but all in vain.Looking forward to your ideas. Thanks.tk"
